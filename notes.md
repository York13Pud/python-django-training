## What is Django?

Django is a web backend framework that uses python.

Django REST framework is used to create API's, which can be used with other parts of Django or on it's own.

It uses the MVT (Model, View and Template) design pattern.

* Model: The data layer that is usually a database.
* View: This is the logical layer that does the processing of the request and then the returning of what the user requested.
* Template: A template is the HTML (or other format) that you want to send back to the user.
